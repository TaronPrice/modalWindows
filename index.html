        It is important to take care of the pain itself, and it will be followed
        by the growth of the patient, but at the same time it will happen that
        there is a lot of work and pain. For to come to the smallest detail, no
        one should practice any kind of work unless he derives some benefit from
        it. Do not be angry with the pain in the reprimand in the pleasure he
        wants to be a hair from the pain in the hope that there is no breeding.
        Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not come out; they are in fault
        who abandon their duties and soften their hearts, that is toil.
